# Java-Learn

## Object-Oriented programming languages 

### UniBo - Computer Engineering

### Bologna - Italy

The course aims to provide an in-depth concptual & practical knowedlge about the basics concepts, methodologies, technologies and tools for the design and development of applications according to the object-oriented paradigm.

The Java language and platform is adopted for this purpose: at the same time, a comparison with other object-oriented languages, such as C#, Scala, Kotlin, is also provided when introducing the main topics of the course, so as to provide a broader view.

**Contents**:

- Basic concepts of programming languages. Language families -- imperative, functional, logic, and object-oriented languages (5hrs).

- Introduction to software design: software components, abstract data types, objects. Basic concepts of the Java language and architecture: classes, instances, object construction and deletion, inheritance, polymorphism. Abstract classes, interfaces, multiple inheritance. (30hrs + 12hrs lab)

- Lambda expressions and functional interfaces. (12hrs + 6hrs lab)

- Exceptions and exception handling. I/O streams and file access, object serialization. Data structures: lists, hashmaps, trees and related algorithms. (20hrs + 12hrs lab)

- Introduction to Java operation streams. (3rhs)

- Basic elements for GUI construction in Java on the JavaFX platform: event-driven programming, event listeners. (10hrs + 10hrs lab)
